<p>Utter a powerful song to Indra, which will
be as sweet as butter and honey.</p>

<p class="right">—Rig Veda.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time, in the
land of Kasi, there lived
a poor musician, who
was also a poet and a
most imaginative storyteller.
He had lost his
flute in a village brawl,
and being too poor to buy a new instrument had
to content himself in relating wonderful legends
concerning the gods, and stirring tales about the
jungle people.</p>

<p>One morning, feeling the necessity of communing
with his spirit in quiet and solitude, he wandered
into the jungle under a favorite cluster of
bamboos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus2.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>His soaring imagination was checked in its flight
by a song of so extraordinary a tune, so novel and
strange to his ears that he fancied he had been
carried up by unknown favor to Indra’s heaven.
The heavenly singer was only a small bird with
feathers like old gold, two eyes green as emeralds,
and the beak and legs of the same color.</p>

<p>And the Golden Bird spoke to him: “Asneha!
thou hast acquired great merit by thy devotion to
matters spiritual, by thy kindness to animals and
to human beings. Therefore, if thou wilt cut a
reed within these woods they shall repeat my songs
to thee.</p>

<p>“But have a care, thou must remain pure and
not suffer to be deluded by the love of woman,
and thou shalt conquer the world.”</p>

<p>He cut a flute in haste and pressed his lips to it
to utter a song from it. And verily the music
which flowed from its opening was divine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
golden beyond description. Sometimes it sang
softly as the moonbeam plays on a silent lake of
emerald, dancing and trembling with so gentle a
rhythm that only the soul of a poet could hear its
melody; at other times it swelled its notes to the
power of the roaring Maruts smiting against the
unmovable Himalayas, as the wrath of Kali with
the shiver of the cold snows from the eternal
summits. Again, its melody dripped sweetly as
the whitest of honey with the scent of a thousand
flowers, of innumerable forms and shadings the
most delicate. It wept, also, a song of despair
and misery, so sadly, so pitifully, that it caused
the tears to surge as readily as the Fountain of
all the Sorrows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="400" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>So he incised on his flute this motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Once upon a time the Golden Bird sang to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Now I shall sing a golden song to the gods.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He went from village to village, from city to
city, playing with the generosity of an inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
poet, followed by man, woman, child and beast
alike, whenever he put his flute to his lips. They
offered him their homes, their riches, their dearest
possessions, but he scorned all, accepting only a
little rice with spices, partaking of shelter with
the humblest when the tempest-beaten jungle forbade
his sleeping out of doors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus4.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly his fame had spread, and reached the
ears of the Maharajah, who bade him appear at
the palace, to vie with the court musicians, who
were the most famous in the land. The court
musicians, in their ignorance, eyed the half-naked
poet with a defiant leer, as one by one they began
playing, while nearby sat the Maharajah
with his daughter, the fair Mahismati, and the
courtiers around, all fairly laden with gems, appearing
as enormous glistening scarabei.</p>

<p>They sang and drummed, they scratched their
fiddles and twanged their guitars, they played the
harps and clanked the cymbals to the admiring
assemblage of noblemen, who wondered how this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
miserable, half-starved vagabond dared to compete
with his wretched little instrument.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus5.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>When the musicians had ended, Asneha got up,
announcing the Song of Songs.</p>

<p>It began imperceptibly, but as insinuatingly as
the language of a couple of loving eyes whispers
to another loved pair; so indistinct to the ear that
it was as the incipient melody in the mind of the
composer.</p>

<p>Then it continued, soothing and muffled as the
patter of small naked feet dancing the nautch on
the marble flooring; rattled speedily as an incessant
cascade of rubies, diamonds, sapphires, pearls and
emeralds on a basin of gold. Steadily it flowed, like
a Song of Desire and Voluptuousness, filling the
hall with a scarlet inundation of light; heavy and
numbing as the exhalation of soporific flowers.</p>

<p>But now it ascended to healthier altitudes like
a Song of Victory and Exultation, direct and
concise, in a blast of crystal trumpets, higher,
slowly, in the manner of the eagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus6.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It rang forth agitated and sonorous as a gong,
yet farther, solitary, inaccessible.</p>

<p>Then as if it had grown in magnitude by the
ascent, it roared like a planet as it shoots into
space to restore the equilibrium of the Universe,
and suddenly, unexpectedly, in the fashion of the
shooting star, it stopped short, carrying in its wake
the exhausted assemblage of listeners to the floor
as a mass of inert flesh.</p>

<p>One by one, as do the reeds after the violent
gust of wind has blown over, they raised themselves,
but not quite so erect as before. The musicians
approached him humbly, and breaking
their instruments, threw them at his feet, salaaming
and promising never to play again from that
day on.</p>

<p>Then Rajah Nila spoke: “Oh Asneha! Thou
art indeed a great musician, and thou shalt be
rewarded as befits a king; my riches, my kingdom,
my daughter, are thine for thy choosing!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rajah!” answered Asneha, “I am only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a poor man and a musician by divine grace, but I
am not a beggar, and have no desire for thy kingly
gifts and thy fair daughter!”</p>

<p>The astonished Nila replied: “Assuredly
thou art richer than am I, for thou art freed
of all desires! But let me be a beggar for once,
and entreat thee for another song!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus7.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Pavana, the messenger of the gods, appeared
to Asneha mounted on his white antelope,
a flag in one hand, in the other an arrow, with
a command from Indra to present himself immediately
to the gods. So he mounted the antelope,
and in less time than it takes to think it, he
was carried to the eastern spur of the great Mount
Meru, which is Swargra, in the City of Asmaravati,
the heaven of Indra. All the gods had
assembled there. Above all towered the great
and mighty Indra, the Ruler of the gods and Lord
of the Firmament, mounted on his elephant Airavata,
at his right his dog Surana, and at his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his wife Indrani. Farther to the left was Surya,
the god of the Sun, on his winged horse Tarkshya.
Agni, the god of Fire, on a blue ram,
and Varuna, the god of Waters, on his terrible
Makara.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus8.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>At Indra’s right was Yama, the god of Death,
on a blue buffalo, with his twin sisters, the Yamunis,
at their feet, the Sarameyas, their faithful
watchdogs.</p>

<p>On Yama’s right was Kuvera, the god of
Wealth, with his sister Kuveri, in their aerial car
of jeweled lapis-lazuli.</p>

<p>Then Soma, the god of the Moon, on a white
antelope, and Mangala, the god of War.</p>

<p>Also the goddess of Love, Radha, and all the
lesser gods in magnificent array, in all their splendor,
in all their beauty and power, watching
silently Asneha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus9.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Indra patted Airavata, and then spoke:</p>

<p>“Oh Asneha! Thou hast conquered the world
with thy songs, and thou hast boasted to conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the gods too! Now make thy boast good, or
thou shalt go into the keeping of Yama!”</p>

<p>Asneha looked around, a little dazed by this
gathering of Immortals; he then shook his long
black hair, as if to conquer timidity, and then
began his Golden Song.</p>

<p>Pure and exquisite as the breath of woman
with teeth like pearls, as fragrant as the rose of
Cashmere, it sang, now jocund, now sad, as the
moods of love-sick Radha; plaintively yearning
as an appeal to love in the stillness of the starless
night; joyous and eager as the meeting of desirous
lips; languishing as the woman’s heart fainting
under the first kiss of the loved; it redoubled
powerful, passionate as the march of the conquering
male who has subdued. Abruptly it altered
the rhythm as if awakening in readiness for battle,
with the clamor of an army lusting for carnage,
with the clank of swords, the discordant clash of
shields, armors and spears, the dull thud of shattered
bones and skulls, vehement imprecations,
deep blasphemies, full of rancor, hatred and vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus10.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Then succeeded a silence, heavy, full of terrible
signs, as of a silent flapping of wings, of a roaming
of untold shadows, blacker than the night.</p>

<p>It repeated the death-song of the jackal and
the hyena, with its harassing, fiendish chorus, pursuing
in a mad dance with strange rhythms, the
lively reel of the black scavengers on the silent
and pale corpses. Then it died out, purling and
gurgling as life ebbs out of a tortured body from
a deep and crimson wound.</p>

<p>Pity and compassion returned to the song,
gently, caressingly, as if nursing multiple
wounds, infusing sympathy and life, like the
wind, which laden with coolness and fragrance,
sweeps over an arid and desolate valley.</p>

<p>It broke into a chant, strong and overwhelming,
and so irresistible that it was as a strain of
Perfect Joy; persevered tenfold, omnipotent, with
a note so true, so deep and so infinite that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was like a sip of the Amrita, blissful and oblivious.</p>

<p>All the gods encircled Asneha, instinctively,
irresistibly, as the cobras surround the snake-charmer
when he plays to them his captivating
melody.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="page" src="images/illus11.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>They stared at him fixedly as if to get the
sound from its original source, and when he had
ended they stood one instant stock-still, dumb,
overflowing with admiration and ecstasy. Then
they all pressed around him, speaking and shouting
confusedly like ordinary mortals. But a hush
fell over the assemblage as the great Indra slowly
made his way to Asneha, and for a while stood
absorbed and pensive, looking at the musician.</p>

<p>He then spoke with his clear, sonorous voice:
“Asneha! Verily thou hast made thy daring
boast good, therefore thou shalt become immortal
too!</p>

<p>“I cannot offer thee what is earthly, for thou
canst acquire all earthly things with thy song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
But I have created a gem which comprises all the
harmonies, all the melodies of music in color. It
is ever changing, ever beautiful and imperishable
as are your songs. Take it, and delight with it
the mortals!”</p>

<p>To the kneeling Asneha he extended his palm,
where scintillated, luminous and irradiating as a
perfect song, the Opal.</p>
